                <p>A collection of all the ventures from Milwaukee to Hong Kong! The photos 
                    aren't in order but I think I might organize the captions when I find a gallery. Anyways going back 
                    to this entire photo collection is just a quick highlight of all the places I have gone to. Although 
                    I haven't traveled for awhile the next time I do I defiantly am planning to snap more shots. 
                </p>

                <p>Starting with Milwaukee this is the place where I do my interning and school. The hustling and bustling city 
                    life really revitilize me. Yes Milwaukee itself is already a huge city to roam around and you can easily get 
                    lost in the city's maze of shops and office buildings. 
                </p>

                <p>Next up is the metrapolis city of Chicago where heck it will take you weeks to finish exploring every part of the city. From 
                    the fresh smell of coffee lurking in the corner to a work space like no other with vibrant decorations this is the perfect 
                    city to be in. I think that this city defiantly lives up to its name THE WINDY CITY! Yes it can get chilly here and there but 
                    once again the weather in this state in general changes. 
                </p>
                

                <p>After the Windy city comes the city that doessn't sleep which is basically Hong Kong, China, and Macau all combined! In a city that 
                    is lit up with bright lights flashing beckoning you to come in it is a place you defiantly don't want to dismiss.
